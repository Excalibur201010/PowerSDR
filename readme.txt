The source tree includes 2 projects which can be compiled 
in Visual Studio .NET 2008.  The solution file (PowerSDR.sln) in 
the Source folder will compile both projects and output the 
files to the bin\Debug or bin\Release folder depending on which
version is being compiled.

The PowerSDR solution has been upgraded to Visual Studio 2013.  

Build complains that DttSP has a different linker and target directory.
Since I have no plans to modify the DttSP, I have unloaded that project.

Added logging support for CouchDb, so relax.
